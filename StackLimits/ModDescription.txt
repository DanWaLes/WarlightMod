This mod, prevents territories from crossing a customizable amount of armies on it. If you deploy armies, make sure they don't go over the army limit, since that will delete those that go over the cap. Same goes for the game creation(so if you make e.g. custom scenario or set starting armies per territory, verify that those are not over the limit). You don't have to worry about losing armies due to transfering, the orders will be adapted so you don't lose any.
