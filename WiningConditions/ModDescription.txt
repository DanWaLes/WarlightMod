This Mod allows you to set more wining conditions than just eliminate all players. The conditions count for every player(not for a team). To see your progress open the settings. AIs can't win with the extra wining conditions. Commanders aren't supported. Warning! Don't use this mod on big maps(~1000+ territories)(that could make the game unplayable). Any kind of territory modification by a mod isn't supported at the moment. A game with this mod takes at least 1 turn.
