This Mod allows you to add other income forms that just holding boni for Commerce games. The money is calulated runtime(means if someone captures a territory and the loses it to an other player, both players get the money for capturing the territory. Same for boni). Be careful with the feature MoneyperCapturedBonus cause it is only useable without any risk for maps with less than 1000 territories, more territories are on your own risk(can happen that you can't commit anylonger) to disable it set it to zero.
