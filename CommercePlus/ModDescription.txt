This Mod allows you to add other income forms that just holding bonuses for Commerce games. The money is calculated runtime(this means, for example, if someone captures a territory and then loses it to an other player, both players get the money for capturing the territory. Same for bonuses). Be careful with the feature MoneyperCapturedBonus cause it is only usable without any risk for maps with less than 1000 territories, more territories are on your own risk(can happen that you can't commit any longer) to disable it set it to zero.
