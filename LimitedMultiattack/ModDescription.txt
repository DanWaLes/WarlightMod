Every territory has a set value(depends on settings). If you attack a territory, it's value is set to the value the attack came from reduced by 1. If it's an transfer the value on the territory the order went to is set to -1. If you fail to attack, the value on the territory the order came from is set to -1. If the limited multiattacks feature is bound to playing a card, the start value is 1. You can only attack/transfer if the value on the territory the order comes from is greater than 0, exept the basic value is 0, then it is bound to a card. If someone has a better description send it to dabo1.
