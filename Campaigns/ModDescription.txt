This Mod allows you to create your own Campaigns/Story Scenarios!
Right now, I am working on the Singleplayer version of it, implementing this for the Multiplayer will be much harder and will make your Input much more complex. So I will first keep it simple - for me and for you - and will (maybe) include the Multiplayer Features later.

To create your Campaign, you have to add it into the "Code" Lines in the Mod's options. There are several commands for you to use:
- message [text]; one of the most important commands for creating your story. Will open a text window for the user.
Example: message 'Welcome to this world!' will open a window with the text Welcome to this world. You need to put the text in '...'

- go to ['l'+number]; THE most important command of all. Include at the end of a line to show which line will be executed next. You can enter multiple lines, split by commas, to execute multiple lines in an specific order.
Example: message 'Stuff' go to l3 will open a window with the text Stuff and then execute line 3.
Example 2: message 'Stuff' go to l3,1,5 will first execute line 3, then line 1, and then line 5.

- when [action] ['at'+time (optional)] do [command]. Will execute the [command] when the [action] happens. The time describes when the Mod should check if the [action] is happening. Possible actions:
1.) [player] takes [territory] - [player] can be Player or Enemy, [territory] ist the Territory's name (or 'any' if no specific territory is adressed). When the player successfully attacks the territory.
2.1.) [player] owns [territory] - When the player owns the territory (time recommended, e.g. when Player owns Prag  at Turn End)
2.2.) [player] owns [territories] - Same as 2.1.), but in [territories] multiple territories can be listed (seperated by commas). The player must own all of them to continue. any,any,any,Prag will execute the command when the player owns Prag and 3 other territories.
3.) [player] attacks [territory] ['from'+territory (optional)]. When the player attacks the territory.
