This Mod is moved to the mod custom card package
You need to add Reconnaisance cards to this game, otherwise this mod will not take effect. This mod removes armies from the territory you select and from its  connected territories. But please note the card is still called Reconnaisance and it still has the Reconnaisance effect in addition to nuke. Only in the history it has the name "nuke". If the percentage set is greater than 1, at least one army always gets killed, because it is rounded up. If you want, you can also allow/forbid players to harm themself. You can also configure when the order should happen (before or after deployments).
