You need to add Reconnaisance cards to this game, else there won't be any effect. This Mod adds to the Reconnaisance card the features of a nuke card, which effects the territorys it hits and their connected territories. But please note the card is still called Reconnaisance, just in the history it has the name nuke and note, that the Reconnaisance effect still exists on the card. The Card will take effect BEFORE Deployment. If a nuke card is played, one armie gets always killed and else its rounded. If you want, you can also allow/forbit players to harm themself.
