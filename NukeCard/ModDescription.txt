Warning you won't recieve any new card pieces (will be fixed soon).
This Mod rewrites the Reconnaisance card to a nuke card. The territory it is played on will lose 50%of its armies and all connected territries lose 25% of their armies. The attack also effects own territories. But please note the cards are still called Reconnaisance, just in the history they have the name nuke and you need to add them to your game too. But please note, that the Nuke will give you a view on the effect.
