This Mod allows you to limit the number of armies a player can deploy on a territory. If a players territory reaches the limit, the armies will be deployed on other territories. If every territory reached the deployment limit, the armies will be lost. This Mod doesn't work perfectly, if the mod stacklimit is executed before this mod.
